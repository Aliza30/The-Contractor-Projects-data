# 📘 Contractor Projects Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Contractor Projects data to extract meaningful insights using Python, specifically NumPy and Pandas, along with data visualization libraries.

The dataset includes structured information related to construction projects such as cost, duration, contractors, and locality, making it ideal for exploratory data analysis and visual storytelling.

This notebook (Programming.ipynb) demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into actionable insights through systematic analysis and visualization.

## 🎯 Dataset Description

The Contractor Projects dataset contains the following key attributes:

* Project Cost – Total cost involved in the project

* Project Period / Duration – Time span of the project

* Contractor Name – Entity responsible for execution

* Number of Buildings – Scale of the project

* Type of Project – Residential, commercial, infrastructure, etc.

* Locality / Community – Area where the project is located

Think of it as a **foundation-layer artifact** for anyone leveling up their programming skills.

## 🔍 What This Analysis Explores

Through this notebook, we aim to:

* Compare project costs across contractors  
* Analyze project duration versus project scale  
* Understand which localities have higher project concentration  
* Identify patterns across different project types  
* Summarize contractor performance using grouped statistics  

This analysis helps answer key questions such as:

* Which contractors handle high-budget projects?  
* Do larger projects take significantly longer to complete?  
* Which areas show higher development activity?
